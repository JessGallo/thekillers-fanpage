        <h1> The Killers Fanpage!</h1>
        <p>Are The Killers an overrated band? Perhaps. Are they also severely underrated? Absolutely. What qualifications do I possess to make such a statement? Well, my best friends (all 2 of them) like The Killers, and I like The Killers, and we have excellent taste in all of the finer things in life. </p>
        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>To truly understand what makes the Killers such a fantastic band, we must first understand the background of the band.<strong> SIKE!</strong> You don't have to know anything about The Killers to understand why they rock. The band could have decended onto this Earth from another planet, with every intention of conquering the human race, and none of that would matter because they gave us Mr. Brightside, and for that we should be more than willing to abide by their rules. </p>
        <p>Also, not to bring looks into this, this is a fanpage after all, but have you SEEN Brandon Flowers? He's undeniably rocked some of the most polarizing looks, cue the guy-liner and moustache combo. Yet somehow, if you were to bump into him at Trader Joe's, he would look like any other employee restocking shelves or judging your purchases at the register, and there's just something really neat about that relatibility. The rest of the band is pretty great too. (This maybe should have been a Brandon Flowers fanpage, but it's too late to turn back now). </p>

        <h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
        <p> If you're not fully conviced on my Top Songs list, that doesn't really matter. This is my fanage bud, make your own. However, I will make the argument that my top song, When You Were Young, is both an audio and a visual experience. I watched this music video and began a new life in that moment. So for you viewing pleasure, I present, <strong>The Killers</strong>.</p>
